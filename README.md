Versionning
-----------
Karme use semver. It supports PHP 5.6 until Karma 5.6 version.
Next version dropped 5.6 support but also 7.0 to 7.3 one : that's why we jumped from Karma 5.6 to ... Karma 7.4

As Karma is a mature tool and do not need to evolve, versionning currently follows php's one for easier compatibility reading.
